with constant light.

“Spiritual Father:

Lord, may our meditation on the cross

illumine all that we do, so that cross becomes

the reality of our daily living”


The only comparable teaching on the subject is that of St. Paul when, writes St. Cyril of Sinai, “he speaks of laying aside the whole armour of God and entrusting himself to Christ who is the Standart and Baptism of faith and the Church as a compass”.204

“Christ unites us with himself by the spirit,” writes St Thomas Aquinas, “and without ourselves entering into union, that causes in our hearts a vehemence of love, so that the will rises to Christ in such manner that it delights in everything the Son alone wills, even as the totality of the will of Christ delights in the Father. The soul more perfectly thus consents to the will of the others, to the wife to her husband, to the son to his father and the fellow-disciple to Christ”.205

“Who is it?” asks Evagrius, who has been describing the condition of the soul that aspires “to be one with God by love.” It

It is


is a question may be lightly put, but it is one to which no one has yet found an answer. Who? It will ask itself that question for ever. It prays then and there, that it may be addressed once viva voce. It would care little even, if it be addressed in words — it wants to see, to touch, to feel who, because of what Christ is in God, thus takes possession of him, if it is no man, how can it come to pass that there are two, an human being and a God and if he is a man, how can he be with God by grace, how can it be that there are two in one? And what more? What the coming uprisen Lord has answered, putting an end to the care of his disciples, on ascending into heaven will answer to the soul that is so close to God, as to Lazarus and Paul of Tarsus206.

“In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col. 2:9)”: here is a fundamental image in the Christian conception of the Divine Life, a conception that is strictly monophysite, though in a sense not different from that defined by St Cyril as “seeing double in one”. One here is the Eternal God, who, as St Cyril says: “words cannot contain in their depth nor are they admitted to do so, because they fall and dissipate in the sea of incomprehensibility”. The other is the Incarnate God, who nevertheless is

“Flesh of the Word”


for none of the “incomprehensibles” is any longer incomprehensible, that is for men. For on the altar, in front of the divine Cross, Christ is “in tangible form as in the carnal”207 and as men, redeemed and invested by His Presence, these redeemed ones — or rather these transformed ones who, in the Liturgy and in the Monastic life, have opened themselves to this Presence — “build through faith and love on what has become foundational realities of participation and divinisation, namely compassion and humility, living by all the Commandments.208

The power that the saints call “vertical” comes in part, says Jordaeuves, from hierarchical participation in Christ Himself in glory and in part ascends, by grace, from below: the Holy Spirit given in Baptism pours out the goodness's communicated in it to all creatures, “not only to saints where they are active by their own merits, but also to the reprobate, non-saints and even — as much as he is — to the demons, who are inferior and “reasonable””.209

Consequently, for not only men but also for Angels, for Paradise one or for the “reprobates” and for Hell, the paradise of brutes, the gate of Heaven — guarded by St Michael the Archangel — remains shut: “No pagan can go where God's children play, no demon where the angels have gone.”210

The only difference from the “vertical descent” of God and the Holy Trinity is that of degree. Underlined, as ever, by St. Gregory Palamas, after the “vertical” descent comes the “horizontal” descent of the Son of God in glory, together with the three Persons of the Trinity.211 No creature was given to reach God directly; man himself only hears the voice of God by the intermediary of
