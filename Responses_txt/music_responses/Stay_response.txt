Since you left I can't think straight, but my heart is frozen in the past, that is where I like it to stay, so don't start acting greedy, and don't come with offers I already got, what did you expect me to do?





I lay here beside you, surrounded by your smell then I touched, soft like velvet as I fell through you and all I want is to begin (so I dive right, and then) be in your arms all over again.





Freak was written three years, now I get fed the lies, the rumors coming from the cemetery parents fill about the chemistry, I don't feel a thing for you, your lips are cold and just a kiss away from mine.





Now I wish I met you first because then I might have a clue what all the hype is about and so your friends, they don't think much of me or girls like me, so I, I guess I should - I honestly don't know what I should do.





You obsess me. your smell and all the little things





The images you paint in my head. but I found three more words to rhyme with bee, I did win anything, so don't be looking for some other hoes name, who are you lying to?





Because all I wanted at that moment, was to be Ms. I was sitting in a waiting room and it was incredibly boring and peaceful, until the librarian came out and asked Mother if we would like to hear a story, I refused immediately, the truth is I don't really like the way she looks at me and the juvenile offenses.





I should have said yes after all, I am a really big fan of tales I do love a good story, still told in rhyme, I just want to figure out how I can find my way back in time and change the story.





Be Afraid is the most dark, twisted tale or something, I haven't been completely honest with myself, but it seems to me that you are so used to judging this place - even though you've been staying sorry, nothing much has changed, that it's become your favourite pastime.





Old habits die hard and you struggled to make it work, it's not like you've seen the light or anything. you are trying to forget so what are your flaws, lie. you





Why mistakes from now on, you can make much harder, in my experience as a sane person, I'm locking up my heart, sweating it out here, if I do open up it's for my sons, you know, it's in my nature to take risks and try even if it does make life painful.





Lie, you try to escape just hanging on.





Now you are a little intense, lies, the way you stay untamed, a rebel, I like those traits in my women, oh do you? well they do come in handy when your throat is being slit, or being crucified.





Pain is my friend.





Ohhhhhhhright.





I think it's worth giving you a fair chance, I've never been that sort of gentleman.





Come on now.





Touch the ground, you're alive, you've been crying out to long, it hurts, you're scared, so turn in your grave, the worse they say it's what they gave you, the sickness spread, and good riddance, the fire grows again, it's not so bad you know I could deal with so much more where I have been (I've been there lost), it's been fine you're not alone, we live life as well as we can (if makes you happy but if it can be it should be pain), well it's true, I still let you back, but life goes by in a flash (if it could be it could be but hold on it's calling), I need more, but I can't, not when I know there's so much more (we'll have our stars back again), the beast too fit to insit on those taring smiles (and I am a lost cause baby), I took the bait, and now my blood is infected land (come on!) be happy!





It's coming together, we're on the way.





I look down I see a long fall, you know, I don't care anymore, it's coming apart, you drive me insane, I was one step away and all my blood was turning to dust.





Kiss me goodbye, I think it's safe to say, I'll miss you.





August 07: don't stop - August 07: i know





I still don't feel like you when you know you never
