Are you drunk just raising your glass to the sky Saying cheers to the me behind my eyelids? Cause you feel dumb and you think dying's fine And I used to feel alone But now I know I'm not And I just want to feel All of your pain Cheers to the reason we cry And the lies that made us try And the time we hold inside of the the love To hate someone that's you [Chorus]

Everybody hurts sometimes That's why everybody takes change

And there's no side to take Cause that's the only way You can even make everyone change 'Cause everyone wakes up one day And they see it too Everything's gonna be alright Your soul is screaming too You can ignore awhile But You can never ignore everything Everything 'Cause yeah we're, we're drinking

Everybody, everybody hurts sometimes Everybody hurts someday But everybody's crying so what I say Cheers to the one that's alive And you don't cause to wonder why So here's to you only a moment in time It's flowing fast, so fell what you miss That's lose time, you drink it all to do.

Is it too much, is it now soothe? Uh-huh [Chorus]
