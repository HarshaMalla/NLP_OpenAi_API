Throw your hopes overboard And just wait to get taken from the shore



Am I living in a box Under a sink? Tell me, am I living in a box? Under a stopper?

I'm dizzy from the heights But I also know And I'm going crazy from the cure Just don't you... forget



You'll shower me with verses and you'll whisper them right in my ear And I hope you pull me out of here Cause I feel sick



Stick with me and I'll stay Inside your head You'll find I beckon you And lead you upside the ground Everybody's feeling nervous It's alright Joy is around the bend Don't leave, don't leave Joy is right around the bend



Stick with me and I'll stay Inside your head You'll find I beckon you And lead you upside the ground Everybody's feeling nervous It's alright Joy is around the bend Don't leave, don't leave Joy is right around the bend



Oh, whoa



I don't wanna be here anymore Always want the finer things ain't never got 'em until you're gone

That's how the brighter, brighter fix goes more complicated than a mind can make it more complicated than a mouth can...



You reel all my emotions

Maybe you love how I fall apart

Leaning on your side and barely hangin' on... Now I can't hear a sound



I've got a big mouth big news couldn't lose

Slow on the edge surprise

All messed up in love

Are we digging it up from down below? Nobody knows what they want to do but they're gonna' anyway



You're my crutch



Chance to the edge with my head in everything So what to do? With all these second chances I had.



Do you like me? Are you drinking? You're empty, we're coming up for air



Heartless and heart broken Can't think at all, can't escape



The man without sorrow And the blinded fool (Once upon a fool) How could I get another letdown?



Can't you see that I? I want...



Shaways and shifts to the future with slower eyes In the past you see your bloodied shoulder bouncing on a hook You didn't know I did it



Pain that welcomes you; wrapped in the glory of pleasure, will you yield to my ways?

Tourist, you carry it comfortably; that looks like a sideburn of yours just and folded into time, I'm glad it's mine.



Now feel it.



Another you: could you?

Another me; I'm everything these other men are not Begging with their eyes and fooling me



Throw your hopes overboard, just wait to be taken from the shore.



I'm dizzy from the heights. If you've got me and you like me, don't forget.
