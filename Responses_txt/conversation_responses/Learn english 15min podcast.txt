Oh, we've got good habits now So I'm gonna go first. So my, I've been in Korea for six years now, going on seven years coming up. And I have never got sick of the food. Yeah, me neither. I know, right I'm so lucky. There are places I know friends who come and they get ill in Korea. And I'm, I don't know. I just ate local. I've always been kind of a bit fussy with like cutlery, though. I like eating with chopsticks. Yes You do So that's a little bit harder and maybe it's harder on your jaw. But yeah Sorry, too much. What did you say about you being fussy about like the cutlery I just don't like the cutlery. I have one set of two knives and two forks that I bring to every restaurant when I'm out because I'm just so very fussy. I've got like my own knives and forks that I bring. And when I go to restaurant and I sit down, I pull them out, put them on the table, and then white napkin, that's just how I, that's really how I get down with my chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks. Okay, you'll crack many trades, teal Deal So I a, when I entered Korea and I was like living in the, in the countryside of Korea. And the country, you know, all like farm, farm and like I guess, you know, because I look at all the buildings and houses, like, hay was spread everywhere, cows and pigs, you know, like all kinds of animals, like that. So during that time, all I could see on TV was eating. Doctor who, you know, all like about eating meat, beer. And so for me, I start to eat goat, you know. Stop the laughing, please So I start to eat goat. And I know that like some people don't, but each and every meal is delicious. I'm so used to it, I'm annoyed if I go to Australian restaurant and they're really really bad in terms of they don't have native food. I want my Korean food everyday. So that can be, so that's it I'm just go to go eat a Korean restaurant, I'm there. How about you Luke Eight years ago a 5 o'clock in the morning, I still went to a bakery and got some bread, right. And I realized that the quality of bread that I could get between 7 PM at night at Butterland And the quality of bread that I can get in the morning was something else. And I was like, what? How's that possible. So I started then like looking out at the bakery and I was like suspicious, like why do I need to get in the bakery in the morning then other times in the day. Yeah, exactly. I'm already swimming in bread. What am I going to do with bread Anyway, it just started from there. And I became like quite addicted to it. And actually, right now, I'm trying my hardest to cut down my bread addiction because it's just getting excessive. Yes, I notices it too that Korean bread. It's just the best bread ever. Otherwise, you can get really bad bread really really fast. I'm starting then to like shift to it because Korea is getting same on everywhere. You can get same products from different places, different kinds of bread. I think that's it. So you know, you have to have your bread every morning. You don't It's not for breakfast. I eat it for lunch too. Right, I eat it for dinner as well. Sometimes, when I'm at home, I'm just munching on some bread in the morning. It's just so good. Right, so good. Maybe you should think about cutting down. Maybe you don't need bread every day. Maybe you don't need bread every day. Maybe so. Well, maybe not just bread. Okay. But we hope you've learned a lot today. And now you're gonna be a more critical consumer of food. And you're going to be more careful about what you're putting into your body.
