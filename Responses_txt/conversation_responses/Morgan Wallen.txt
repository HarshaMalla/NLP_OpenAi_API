It's not, you know, something you would listen to on repeat a hundred times. No, it's not... Stop. I haven't heard it that many times, but even still-- He hasn't won a SOCAN songwriting award either. So something isn't here, okay? Still, I mean, explain to me what this success is predicated on? I mean, in your mind, not from an aesthetic standpoint. Right, because there is, first off, something about this song that is consciously trying to evoke an, I don't know, an early 2000s kind of indie rock hit-making production, or an early 2000s attempt to actually replicate that sound and that period of writing. Like Ben Kweller. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. You know, the real-ish drummers, real open mics, acoustic guitars, these little handclaps, those are all intentioned. And you're right. There's something non-ironic about them. I think there's something non-ironic in that he kind of sounds like a loser. An okay guy. Like I'm just, like I'm okay, like I'm a normal dude. So I feel like, if anyone... I really believe that, like the success of this song presents the major problem with art when it comes to taste and provocation, Matt. Folks with no taste, folks that don't listen, who don't get the cues, who don't internalize the messaging of popular music, went crazy for this song at first, and they remain easily taken in by it. I feel like this also tracks, you're right, that kind of sound is trying to evoke some kind of non-referential point of departure in which you don't have to know any of the allusions, anything. Cause you look at his ratings, his reviews on Apple Music, even if we suspended disbelief, I really tried to listen to the music objectively and made it look like it was good music, a review, a 6.5 out of 10, okay. So people love it. I like that they like it, but I just don't love it. I don't get it. One day long gone. I was justified, oh it was over. Come on! How did I move on so quickly? Thinking every night that you were in my bed, I could have let you slip away. Just like yesterday. You were within my reach, yeah, oh how it all set in. But you were gone by the next light bright day. Right. Tell me. Why? These songs, though... I guess you don't want to talk about those, or...? I think what it's about is there's a problem of identification because listening to the lyrics of these songs is boring. I mean, I don't know. I like being told a good story in anything. I'm not just talking about music. I love smart writing because I know when to laugh. I love times when I think it's painful, but I don't hate it. But these lyrics are cliched, they're very easy, they're anodyne, they're vague. They don't necessarily mean anything. That's kind of the point, whatever you get out of it. That's your own thing. And you know what? Those are the kinds of things that people like and I don't... I can't. This is just not to my tastes for sure. Tell us what you're gonna play for us. No, yesterday one of the songs... So we played-- Actually, I'm going to go back. We started with Morgan's beat. It's called I Don't Know You. Hey, I don't know you, but I've always wanted to know Yeah! Yeah. Now that you're here, I wanna show you girl Anything in the world that you would like to see Just one glimpse of your beauty More than anything I have to know, baby I just really really really love your music. Do you have a favorite song of his? No. This is just something that popped up on Apple Music. Oh, you're sneakin' on Spotify now with the music reviews. I'm playing it for her. No, but the truth is that I accidentally just stumbled into this Pandora station because I haven't been keeping up, and I was shocked that there were 2,000 ratings. And in the most recent six songs, which are the most popular, he has been rated many fives, which I wouldn't expect. 2,000 ratings for this station. So this is a community of listeners who will tolerate, or will support any song that is successful. They've created a country music station where the terms of their love is like chart data. So let's play a song that made it to number one on their station. This is called Hooked and Barraged. I tried hard to find a way to tell you I needed a reason to try and make it somehow clear to you Good old fashioned love is what I really
