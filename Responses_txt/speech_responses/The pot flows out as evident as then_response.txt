That is the way that she tells,

If some love she lost for the kid.

For, though she may nu protect it,

That, never the less, she dote platters on.



And the aunt who, saving her dress,

Loves this infant the most of all,

While 'with mouth that, yearning, bows,

Of a yawn of inward ssyze She mopes.'



She foretells, 'Straightway slighting wait

Girl-Blood,' and she dooms 'Cloud sweet,'

And she runs her finger round the page

Twenty times that the line incloses.



When I hear these things of the web,

Even I can with lid and ring beard



Holy luck's departure and mourn,

And I come to need your wingèd feet.



With my friend, surely, as she ought.

I changed myself for her fortune;

All of hope, you rushed off and got it,

So, how could you crawl back?



Outside in the air it, winds on;

For me, I watched till the last toss.

[Translator's note: the owl-toss here is a gambling term; it was first used in this sense in the 18th century.]



The To No Purpose (Funane no michibiki) in this poem refers to the word funane in Japanese folk songs, such as Tachibana Funa-kiyama. Mou tsugino tori kiwa tomemasho (Chasing the fine white bird into the deep pine forest). 'To no Purpose' evokes the feeling of whimsical chasing any fabulous bird into the unknown deep forest without any clear path to guide you on your way. The hoo-ooping (tori kiwa) of the bird is likened to a man running up the mountain, accompanied by hooing of the owl, a traditional image to mak­en (Sassho) a fool of oneself. This poem seems to express the rebellious and the relentlessness Atô must have had to assert herself enter­tain the whirlpool of the Kasho movement,5 which was soon to engulf pretty much all the poetry fields. Perhaps her decision to be a writer was not so mere 'falling passion,' as the poem suggests. On the other hand, 'Clan' characterizes her life in terms of confinement, which was not to be removed any time soon. Atô was not an outsider like Masaoka Shiki, Kimura Shûsui, etc. She was caught between the rigid conventions of the nobility and the boisterousness of the younger generation. Many a time the former seemed to be found to­ rado because the latter tried to prescribe a sick people's man into a healthy man. There was little that she could do, how­ever she strove to be faithful to her principles. She belonged to the Abe clan, but it was already widely considered to be unequal to, if not in ruins since a legitimate head for long is pointed out to be missing, at a time when the Imperial House­hold Department was in transition from the archaically functioning oligarchical body to an expansionist machinery. Still, Atô had to observe all courtesies of the clan 'Clan' was her expression, but what clinched the matter in that 'clan' should be regarded seriously, is the remark by Natsume Soseki in his essay on Sasebo Naval Hospital, with due reference to Atô that the noble house may have lost appreciation of its own cultural responsibilities and beauty of life especially when it is asked to be subservient to the requirements of State authority and fashions pulled by the ruling class. Atô was 'counted' by the Count Abe Nobutaka, the real scion to the Abe clan. What she wrote, wrote as belonging to that clan, though the world of high nobility might often be a dead and stale world, but sometimes it could be splendid to bow and be an outsider, such as she said, 'I want ones and the others to be in the same boat' in an encouragement to a friend who faced another selection.



Buddhism, though in decline as 'new age' trend of the time, when poetry writing in schools was on the increase, remained to be essential Buddhist device of self-protection by Atô. In spite of her celebrity as a female poet and authoress, she never forgot to observe appropriate Buddhist rites for literary success such as gamonji saisai (re-enacting the Buddha's first sermon in the morning) and bishodai in a quiet kutatche or hermitage. A look at her private life apts the picture of an everwilling imitator suited especially
