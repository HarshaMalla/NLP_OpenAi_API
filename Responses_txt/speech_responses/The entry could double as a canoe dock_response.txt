The entry is set more than two feet above the grade, following the grade of the lawn.


An exterior wall could hide the hinge. Of course this hinge should be placed above the ground line exactly out on the wall line.

In a housing development of country style homes, one of the homes was built with a steel custom arched front door, as opposed to the plywood and metal shutters usually used in that neighborhood. The owner was quite proud of this door. Unfortunately it had a poor hinge. He rarely opened it, but when he did leave it swung easily on the hinge. As a result the leather hinge flap was often not inside the hardened edge, a standard practice with steel doors and the hinge. The edge overheated and burned through a hole in the leather. This became obvious when the arched front door wouldn’t close and he couldn’t open the door from the inside, or find the pub where he could normally find the access cutouts that covered the hinge. Why? Because the hinges are hidden behind the wall paneling in such a way that makes them inaccessi

A hinge that rusts through is relatively simple to recognize. Look for the hinges to rust through, causing the door to loosen. But hinges don’t rust; they may get oxidized. In that case they are harder to spot. Examine your hinge likely candidates and know how they operate. Doors can hit the hinges; if they do and shake vibrations can loosen the joints around the hinge. Hinges and door schedules (to be discussed below) can rub on the framework and cause the frame to extend into the door, weakening it and possibly coming up, causing a gap between the door and the frame. A misaligned door can cause potential trouble.

Exterior hinges usually function trouble free year after year as long as the hinge stays lubricated and the housing doesn’t rust; then it has the same ticking time bomb of a door on a trailer. Since the hinge, which hides in a hole behind the wall, can’t be seen for an extended period the trapped moisture in the housing can corrode the hinge, causing it to rust up, causing mechanical problems in the door. If a hinge requires more than light hand pressure to operate it may be a candidate for replacement. Water is a wonderful lubricant, on your door water and water vapor is not a good combination to use on a hinge.

Floors pose another problem area. Typically a floor is an extension of the door, the doorset. One of the more serious maintenance problems is the sill which is a vertical member, with screw holes, which rests on the floor. If the house soaks through the sill then the sill rusts, fits poorly into the door, adding to the problems of the doorset. There is a way to repair or bypass a rusted sill, which will be discussed below. This sill board is part of the structural end of the house exterior. The sill holds the weight of the house, and there is a lot of pressure on the sill plate; it is under tension as it holds the weight of the house. Even pressure on the sill plate is a bonus for the flooring of the house.

The most common cause of unhappiness with a separate homes entry door is a bad fit or misalignment. This isn’t the builder’s fault; it is a characteristic of the door schedule. Most homes have a door trim schedule to guide the carpenter/framing crew in the wall construction as they raise the trued bed, finish and plumb the studs, fur wall and soffit, and finish the flooring. This schedule is only used on the exterior portions of the home, walls, roof and so on. The schedule shows where to nail on studs, the top and bottom of the furring channels, plywood and OSB finish, the brick and stone openings, the door height and width, the positions and height of the jambs, and more. (These guides are only found in an exterior door schedule, not in a trim schedule for an interior door, for instance, of which there is one for each room in the house.)

Once the boxes are made or openings occur in the exterior of the home, such as an opening for a door, window or outlet, it is up to the carpenter, who may not be the framer, to cover it, typically by covering the opening with aluminum furring channels, plywood, lacelike metal polycarbonate or some other protective barrier. There is group plate for the jambs which is typically heavy plate; it extends under the door and is nailed on the jambs. Hap’s rule of thumb is always “Always overbuild the door in a small sense, extending all the way down to the concrete and using as much, thick framing as is possible, as well as heavy door hinges, adding whatever is necessary to protect the exterior of the
