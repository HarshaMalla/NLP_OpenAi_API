I think that your physique dictates the type of workout that you should do. My partner and I have something very different in common, and as a result, we do completely opposite training regimens.





James:





Hello guys, we're here with my buddy Tim Barron and he has been on a mission to find what works for him and how to sustain it all year around.​﻿ How are you doing?

Tim:





Good!

James:





How is it going?

Tim:





Not bad, Mr. Hanyak, one time world champion body builder, body transformation expert.​ I enjoy it a lot...

James:





That's nice Tim. You know what, these days, we have got a lot of new guys in the industry and they come up and they tell me, "Oh, I want to be like you or your buddy, or whichever guy". So first of all thank you for giving me some credit there, it's very nice of you and it's really an honor also and it makes me feel good. So let's jump right into it and let's go for the basics with you.​



Who is here, Tim?

Tim:



My name is TIm Barron and I do martial arts and survival work. One day I want to do over 20 marathons/​half marathons.﻿ And I run. I run fairly a lot for well-being and for survival prep.



Basically, now I want to just do a workout that's sustainable kind of thing because I fall apart pretty quickly and I want to change that.

James:





I'm so glad you started this workout early...I mean you got some time to be able to see what different people have been talking about you know, so you've got some time to kind of think it through.

Tim:



And you know what, I really didn't. Because when I came thinking about bodybuilding, I wasn't really looking at somebody as like "Oh, this is what I want to be like...." I like your work and I like your partner's work, so I'm looking at you guys and it's kind of like a little bit video we're going to make here and you know I'm your customer group kind of thing....



I'm looking at this from a survival fitness kind of thing because I want to run marathons, so I can carry weight longer, and I want to do martial arts and I want to do etc., etc., etc.

James:





So I know let's jump right into this because let's run with my thing of survival. How far-off we are from that? The shits gonna hit the fan and before we go out, we're gonna kill each other and dance around the skulls....How close anything,...You know.

Tim:





I'm developing myself in that direction and I think you're looking at things from the same perspective. I would say at the moment we're probably not that far off. I really think a lot of what's going on in the U.S. has a lot to do with manipulation of public views.﻿ There have been programming agendas up and running. For quite sometime now and I really think one of them is an overpopulation agenda. You know, they've had it in the plan to have a breakdown, I wouldn't say on a global level, but the U.S. to have a breakdown by 2010 and 2013 is the enemy line if you will, January of [censored name] is the end of that. Number line.﻿ Abrupt nature will happen, again, it's been preordained. People need to be in a complete panic when that happens, to get all of these seeds out of mind set you know, we've already talked about this, I'm learning from you.



You are humanity collective. What we're looking at, how do we get ourselves ready for this and what do we need for survival for the next 20, 30, 50 even 100 years, especially after a fall-out and that's really what this is coming down to.

James:



What I see on the...I know, it's a little different place, but what I see on the horizon of what's happening, is the entire economy and society is just being taken apart so they can redefine it.﻿ They can hammer it into what they want it to be whatever it is. You know. They're doing alternative trade at a fast pace and all sorts of things are happening you know,﻿ everywhere looking at statistics, looking at and seeing how much money is being lost. The system is being taken apart. We have a definite collapse of the
