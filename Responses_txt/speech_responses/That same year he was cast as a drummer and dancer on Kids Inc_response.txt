In 2003, after trying many schools and programs, and following the advice of many of the professionals working with him and his family, the Eastmans made the painful decision to home school their son. It has been a huge sacrifice for all concerned, especially for them, and the quality time that can't be replaced.







Life struggles have not slowed Jake down however, as there are many kids who are much worse off than he. Going on vacation to big cities and spending time as a typical kid is not an experience he has had much of beyond the movies and stage. Jake also loves to play outside; he likes his baseball glove, soccer ball and football most of all. He takes them everywhere he goes.



It may not seem like it but, he is a typical kid. He loves Tae Kwon Do, the Simpsons, Chuck E. Cheese and his CD " Night Songs Of the Ocean " among many others. He is great buddies and friends with many kids, including Huck Milner, Jill and Little Charles, to name a few.
