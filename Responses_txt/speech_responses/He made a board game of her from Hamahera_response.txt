Hunt up secrets.

Break into chests.

Crumple hooks.

Fix broken wire.

Spread hand prints.

Enlarge the hands.

Use his finger as a pen.

Leave little doll heaps.

Leave a custom knock while renting houses.

Wondered what your neighbors might think.

Left the slow neat work of insects.

Connecting the dots.

Objects he couldnâ€™t find.

Redhaired widow griefsome baby.

Green for poison pill.

A skyhook for his hands.

Camouflaged house skeleton.

Strange shrilling in her head.
