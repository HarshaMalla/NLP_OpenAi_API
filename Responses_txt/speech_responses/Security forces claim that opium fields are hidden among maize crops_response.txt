But the Daily Telegraph visiting villages in the Ziarat Valley area of Qalat, the capital of Zabul province, said it found poppy fields were often openly displayed close to the road, where they could be seen by passing government-led eradication teams and eradicated as a result.



"The narco-barons simply use their contacts to tell the teams where to find them on the road. They can see the choppers from miles away coming," said Hazrat Maruf, the governor of Qalat.



The widespread use of opium as medicine along with widespread use of injection drug use has left vast numbers of children addicted. "There's a huge problem with orphansâ€¦ thousands of families have no husband, so the mothers turn to the drugs to cope," said Rahima Yaqoobi, of the provincial women's development council.



Yet opium farming remains one of the few ways of earning a living. That causes young boys to turn to the production of heroin, which they need to learn fast if they are to make any profit.



No one, in the household or public policy, seems able to break the link between poppy farming and how to cut down heroin and opium addiction, said Yahya Farooqi, of the Tribal Development Program in Qalat.



"They have to have a source of income, but this is their gateway to the world of narcotics over supply, which is exactly the problem," he said.



This admission represents realities that the Western-backed NATO command in Afghanistan and its national supporters, the US, Britain and France do not want to admit. It drags war into a far messier deeper reality as Gomm and Fall suggest in their analysis for Op-EdNews:

The US-NATO occupation authorities in Afghanistan, most European countries, the US government and mainstream US media have been pushing the narrative that the Taliban are the biggest problem and they are responsible for the whole mess in Afghan society, society that has in the West-friendly media been dramatized as "chaotic" and "out of control". This narrative is only a half truth, a reductionist account, heavily laced with hysteric grandstanding.



Neither the insurgency in Afghanistan, nor any of the gruesome insurgent actions targeting Western soldiers and NATO-trained Afghan security forces is motivated by out of control brutal Taliban jihadism. The fact of the matter is that the Taliban and other jihadis are but one actor in the country's multiple and multifaceted proxy war. The United States, Britain, Germany and other NATO-European countries embedded in Afghanistan are the key players of this complicated three-dimensional proxy war which is intensifying. The United States, Britain, Germany and some other Western countries are own blood-letting including the sacrifice of their own soldiers for the defence of the country, the country which they created during the Cold War the so-called surrounding countries (the USSR), and they are using their own had a puppet government to torture, limb and kill Afghans, attack their private and public property.s to fight their original spin-offs in this proxy war in Afghanistan.



For the moment, it seems that the West enjoying the illusion that it has to go on fighting and suffering casualties, instead of signing with the Taliban a peace Treaty followed by demilitarization of the Northern Alliance, comprising the Hazara and Uzbek groups. The three wars in Afghanistan are the civil war, US-NATO War, and the Russian-Chinese War, which can be further simplified into four groups: the US occupation forces, the Taliban and other Afghan Jihadis, the Pakistanis, and Al-Qaeda.



At the surface level, it is NATO that are fighting the insurgents including the Taliban. However, NATO and Al-Qaeda are different sides of the same coin. In a wider context, Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are fighting the Pakistanis and Western soldiers in Afghanistan. It is Pakistan which is trying to secure a gain of controlling Afghanistan, and is paying off the Taliban using the intelligence services. The Taliban are playing the role of mercenaries controlled by their Pakistani paymasters.



It is worth to note that all the Russian leadership including former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, former Solzhenitsyn and now the pseudo-historian Putin, made sure never to grab Kabul, wanting instead to leave the northern areas of Afghanistan, until the World War III.



It is worth to note that since great strategic analyst Sun Tzu wrote 300BC, until US security and defense analyst George Friedman wrote his book 'Supremacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives' in 2001, nobody ever attempted to even envision the brave new world of continual wars of neo-imperialist empires prone to planetary domination.



Few resources are required in imperial wars of global domination. However, what military and economic success (remember Hitler's ill-fated and illfound so called thousand-year reich!) is
