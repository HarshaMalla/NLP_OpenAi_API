Three years on and the club is outperforming its targets - with over 1,000 registered players, 66 adult teams, eight full time staff and over 30 staff members.



But the lack of a pitch at Helynn High School is proving to be a concern.



Manager Stephenson Mahachi is also worried about the sheer amount of time it takes to address the issue.



He said: “Everybody I speak to raises concerns about the pace with which these things are done.



“Four years without a pitch is hard, especially when we want the players to perform well.



“But we will continue to push and fight from here,” he added.



The school land has been allocated for a game and athletics by Alex Salmond in 2018, if planned work on parks and housing was carried out.



Mr Mahachi said, at the end of the day, a team has all it needs to provide for the young players, to successful and experienced clubs.



“They have looked after us well so far,” he said, referring to Glasgow City Council.



Mahamdi said he understands the lack of consultation - after the club ran a similar event in 2011, called Park at the Park.



Which the club successfully completed in 2017, following the departure of the previous local councillor, Jim Coleman.



Mr Mahachi said: “We ran the event with help, support and commitment of the council.



“The council also expressed their support as well. But we haven’t delivered,” he said.



“We are now working on it and we will push it and get the persons involved,” he added.





They will pressurize the council to decide on this one.



When asked what exactly he meant by pressurising, Mr Mahachi added he will not speak about it, but will keep this article updated on their developments.
