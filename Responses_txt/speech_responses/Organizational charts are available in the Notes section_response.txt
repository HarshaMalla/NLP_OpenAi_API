ATTENTION ELDERLY RANGERS!!!

Rangers who are permanent, part-time and/or per diem employees hired after June 30, 1992 and retiring prior to July 1, 2025 are eligible to

establish a supplemental Medicare benefit as part of their wife/husband, not simply wife/husband, survivor benefits. This benefit is based on

the husband/wife's retirement date and the amount of benefits he/she is contributing to the medical plan on the day of retirement. Therefore,

each time a Ranger retires and enrolls in the agency medical benefits plan after June 30, 1992, she/he is eligible for this benefit for a new

spouse. This supplemental hospitalization/S.S. benefits are available as an upgrade to the death benefits available from the State life

insurance and California Public Employees Retirement System (CALPERS).
