Trivia

On Johnny's blog there is a photo of both him and Kelly taken in space aboard a fighter jet, implying they have been able to go into space at least twice, possibly more.

The entire series is loosely based around film noir movies. [1]

Mentioned in the DVD commentaries, Jackson Publick, who voices Johnny, does the voice of Baron Heinrich Wilhelm Friedrich von Friedengbern in the series.

On the Johnny Bravo website, in the "About Johnny Bravo" section of Veronica's profile, there is a photo of both him and Veronica in a romantic skydiving pose. However, that picture was created more than two years before "Important Vacation" was produced. In both "High Johnny" and "Important Vacation", it is revealed that Johnny and Kelly are in a relationship and that they went skydiving, suggesting they may have been together prior to meeting at a monster truck rally.

Comparisons

With his trademark sunglasses and a Mohawk, Anthony "Tony" Bravo is essentially Johnny's Penguin. Both are exceptionally good at their skills, yet still lead a smaller sidekick (in Johnny's case, his little brother Jimmy and for Tony, his best friend Luigi) and love in an acrimonious relationship in which also has a "rival" with a very similar name.

Bravo's dolphin-like physical appearance may be a reference to Dio Brando (AKA Dio), the main villain of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

There are many similarities between Johnny and Johnny Bravo (the character from Parker Lewis Can't Lose ), who himself was based on John Bender from The Breakfast Club . The similarities are their macho attitude and their brown hair, which both of them use gel to spike it up.

In the episode "Total Re-Carl", after Carl is force-fed Johnny's "Muscle Meals", he gains the appearance and voice identical to Johnny, down to the sunglasses. His personality similarly becomes personality traits of the Mutt Cutts van. It may be that Johnny has greatly affected Carl.

Hodge Podge was a name that Little Brother Larry used to call Johnny in the episode "Little Dude". Johnny also referred as his own name in animated form as "Johnny Bon Bon" in "Song of the Lonely Mountain".

Spring Break-In is the only episode not to have the standard Disgruntled Goat opening that is seen in all the other episodes of the first season and is the second part of the Season 1 finale.

In the original series of DIC shorts, whenever he was shot or otherwise injured, blood was never shown; this has been averted in the 2003 series.
