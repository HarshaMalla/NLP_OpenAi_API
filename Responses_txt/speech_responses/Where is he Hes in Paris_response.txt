Mr. Lane:

How was the food, Mr. Pike? It's better every year, Fred. Of course we're nowhere near the old Drummer's, but my wife's become a good cook.


Mr. Pike:

You've always been kind, Mr. Lane. Your father was the same way. Seems a shame.


Mr. Lane:

What seems a shame?


Mr. Pike:

After all these years to close the store.


Mr. Lane:

I'm hardly closing the store, Mr. Pike. I've rented the place.


Mr. Pike:

Used to be Drummer's, rest my soul. Lane's General Store. I remember.


Mr. Lane:

[sings]


("Drummer's is gone, the great store is gone


its towering walls do crumble and fall


We musn't think, we musn't feel


When our heads grow hard and cold


We forget so easily, we forget so easily.")


Mr. Pike:

I don't blame you. This town hasn't changed since my day. You gotta change with the times, Mr. Lane. Like your father always said. E-mail links, credit cards, nine-one-one. It's the same world out there, Mr. Lane.


Mr. Lane:

Well, I've been busy moving in. Empty boxes give you so many ideas. I've got one of those winterization deals now. Put on the insulation myself.


Mr. Pike:

You want me to help you?


Mr. Lane:

No. It's like fly fishing. You don't like to waste time with the takes, Mr. Pike. That's why you carp. [Dick] Lane's is right the way restaurants are right. Good food and not much talk. Minutes fade away. The things you used to think. The long evenings when I smoked. Now, I thought everything should be moving from inside, out. Silurians. Astronauts. Waves of light. But everyone is a cat person, aren't they? And we don't want to think about other worlds. Where monsters trip on wickedness that never sneaks up on us. A drizzle, a light rain, and I pass a gull the color of a sea at twilight. I want the past for all the confusion it's caused. I want the future for all the promises it contains.


Mr. Pike:

I get up too early. I don't sleep well here. Breathing comes natural but sleeping isn't natural no more. I walk down the dew, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh. Everything's so different in the country. Run! A duck! "Turbo" by Hello. The old, friendly face. [Dick] Lane's. Hooray! Check, please! These are great pancakes, Mrs. Lee.


Ms. Lee:

My great-grandmother made pancakes like this. Pan-broed. Nobody makes 'em anymore.


Mr. Lane:

[recites the menu] Pancakes red, white, and blue. The Sound of Music, E.T. Life of Pi. Shrimp Court. A F Minor Opus?


Mr. Pike:

Shrimp Court. I could swear I'm in heaven.


Mr. Lane:

(sings) Mackinac candy. Crabby Patties, snow cones tray, ice-cream cooler, lemonade, hot dogs. See how you'd mind my shop.


Mr. Pike:

Everything's perfect, misses.


Mr. Lane:

Last winter I took my dad to the doctor. He's aging and has some growing to do. We got outside that day, the whole town was closed, including the nursery. The trick is to see adults. The trick is to move. I take DNA results and make a diagnosis. I turn on the water. I flush. I have to go. Lane's General Store will live again. Then we're both shaken. It's her. Mrs. Lee?

Ms. Lee:

[to Mr. Lane]


Mr. Lane:

[to Mr. Pike] 'Scuse me. I have to do something right away. I always think I'm an imaginary character. Something leaves. Then something else arrives in about the same place. It's low tide and the visibility is poor.


[Sounds of the stores being rearranged; Mr. Pike hears himself running]


Mr. Pike:

[as if from a newsreel]


[siren]


[Sound of a vacuum, reverb off]


Mr. Pike:
