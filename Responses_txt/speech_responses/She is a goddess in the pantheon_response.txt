And she's going to help us with these bees.





"Don't come any closer," I warn.

"I'll fly above the swarm. You go slowly."

"How slowly?" Everything beyond me is fuzzy and unreal.

"Well, run slowly."





Here I am talking to a goddess, and she doesn't even give me a pep talk.





It's now or never.





"You don't know why I'm doing this? Why we're staying inside? Why there's a mountain of honey pouring out of a tree?" I gesture to her.

"You're checking for bees."

"And instead of one afternoon…" I swallow. It's harder than I thought. "Instead of one afternoon hunting for arrowheads, we have this bizarre…" I point to the tree, but I have to stop myself not to yell at the bees. "This ludicrous plan that should take at least three to four afternoons—"

"It will take longer than that."

I stop. "How many afternoons has Sophie been gone? One? Two?"

"Don't know."

"And what if you counted like she did? Amaz said it was sometime this morning, right? How long did it take her to go all the way to Boarita?"

"Five hours."

My stomach drops. I've seen how long five hours can last.

"We wanted to be careful." Cas has her head cocked to the side. "I know you're smart, but she's cleverer than you."

A pinch prickles between my shoulder blades. I reach back and touch the rabbit bone in my hair. Reassurance.

But I don't feel reassured at all.





Chapter Fourteen—Cas





I imitate the puffed cheeks of a giant.





Nanako climbs slowly down the tree. She pushes off the lowest branches, then jumps to the ground. Landing badly, she collapses, shaking her left ankle.

It came out of nowhere, clamping its jaws on a squealing Fat Anthony. Her efforts to wrench its jaws open only seemed to grow its appetite.

Chess tried to help her, getting her away from her chicken. Fat Anthony was squashed and braised hours later.

"Did it hurt?"

Nanako sniffs. "This? That went away a minute ago. It's not like anything is bleeding."

"Are you sure? Do you want me to help you look?" I insist, but she gives me a severe, slightly deranged look.

"I'm not going to look at my ankle, thank you. But thank you!" She folds her thumb and index finger under her chin, then tilts her head to the side. "I understand you are our excuse for being inside." She points her finger at me. "Thank you your treat for the bees. I am crazy for you."

That deranged look should be followed by gratitude and my transformation from fearsome wood dwarf to cherished hero.

The game is over. It's a relief Nanako has decided to play nice. I can play a game of cat and mouse, but I'm slower than her, better suited to a clumsy head-on attack.

We back away from the dying bees, watching their flight gradually grow more erratic and dropping more swiftly to the ground. Several times I point out small children to Nanako because I'm able to talk and she's always threatening to hit children.

Nanako sits on the grass, blinking at the almost still swarm of bees. "I see," she says after a long moment of chewing on her bottom lip. She looks to the side, then back at the bees. "I'm certainly eager to help Chess and Amaz since they are so eager to help us."

"I don't believe our relationship is about sacrifice," I say, dragging my hand through the dew-drenched grass.





As usual, the dew is thickest on the long, lush grass. The chunks of fat and chunky are the tastiest.





Nanako picks up a blade of grass with her nail. "You are so strong and smart. If I was your friend, I would go to you and your Nanaye. I could be friends with them."

I prefer a strong enemy I can defeat over a weak enemy I need to ignore or, worse, pretend is my friend.

"I've never settled here."

She looks around. "Is your Nanaye here?"

"I guess." I pick a bug out of the grass and eat it, pretending it is the final argument that I win all the
