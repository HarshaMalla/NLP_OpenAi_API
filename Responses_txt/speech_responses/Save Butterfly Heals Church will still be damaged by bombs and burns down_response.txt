c) The other churches don't need saving, in that case



2b) Destroy the military's weapons cache or assault the military compound.



a. If the hostages are used I'm going to kill Bishop

Flynt because his absence will mark the Batchlor party as irrelevant.



b. Bomb quests do not count as "raids," in my book.



Military has access to these weapons because reason.



(A one-time expedition from a base to a group of bandits does not count as having raided the military.)



3a) Rescue the hostages.



Rescue the hostages - use first aid kit. (My special rules)



Note: When the snipers are killed the maximum amount of rebel pastors will spawn



to ensure there is enough to take the dungeon. If extra are spawned my NPC wife will

step in to kill some fighting if it gets too crowded.



3b) Attack the hostages' camp with a Steel Sword, or Quiver of Swiftness and arrow.



a. If the hostages are used I'm going to kill Bishop

Flynt because his absence will mark the Batchlor party as irrelevant.



b. Nothing special, just use bandits favorite weapon. Bow and arrow.



Weapons are in Riften (East Empire Company HQ), only one batch spawns there.



This counts as using a Steel Sword or Quiver of Swiftness and arrow.



3c) Assault the fortress with a Steel Sword, or Quiver of Swiftness and arrow, or escape.



a. If the hostages are used I'm going to kill Bishop

Flynt because his absence will mark the Batchlor party as irrelevant.



b. Scenario similar to 1c from Riften. How I get there matters not.



If Dragon-born is on the same quest, good news, can capture

set of weapons. If Dragon-born helps, bad news, Dragon-born is

already on quest, method of getting there doesn't matter.



3d) Assault the fortress with care? OK, thank you. Hope your NPC's are safe. Take cover. This is why I sent two quivers of arrows.



a. If the hostages are used I'm going to kill B. Flynt because

without him his Church isn't damaged by the stolen bomb quest.



b. Assaults involving dragons don't count unless I exterminate

them personally.



d. Care? Yes we will, thank you. Weapons in the bottom left of the table.



NOTE: This has been done before, in a realistic and toned down way for my Skyrim Roleplay. I have been asked to do a version of Forced Entry and Table Manners, but with this mod it allows me to do some of my crazy assumptions with the the Dragon Resistance (oh and the Hammerhands quest isn't good enough, it's just the loss of forced entry that might get me riled). As you see my list of prohibited actions is very, very long, so I can't see many people completing this quest list. That's not a bad thing, in fact I kinda like having very long quest list to ruse so it's bad luck on players with ill mod combination.



I'm not the sort to aim for a practical mod, my purpose is a dream come true. Err, rather I make myself happy (this is a solo adventure).



Anyone who likes it should feel free to make a patch for it.



Have fun!





NOTES



I call this a 'dream' mod because I make a few extra rules for myself for the sake of game play and my will to dream a little. These rules will make the dreams less attempted, of course:



1. Hunting in this game is rather hard, so I turn it into a bit of a harsh reality. My player character doesn't hunt. I will buy animal meat and use majority mods (or create patches myself) that markets meat and fish. As the Dragon born I have access to the cheat-like command ~ dump 000AC7CD , this command reloads all unlocked vendor's inventories (essential NPCs also have this command) that I find on my travels. Makes live a bit easier with respect to dragons on this list.



1a. Replace my cold-blooded murderers with confused civilians. Dragon attacks are a fairly uncommon occurrence in Skyrim and hardly any of them get villages to work together to stop it. Civilians still run, but only at the first sight of a dragon. If you get them to perform other than standing idle.



1b. Relevant NPC's in the future will spawn randomly with either difficulty
