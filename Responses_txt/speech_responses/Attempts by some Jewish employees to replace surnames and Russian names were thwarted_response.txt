A prominent Russian Jewish engineer, Viktor Asimov, was fired by the same Felix Dzheremishev in 1929 because, in the official record, his noble sounding surname of Asimov had been scratched out and his name changed a short, unmelodious sounding Avrumi. Because of this humiliation, Asimov emigrated to the United States. Asimov's design for a super-aircraft named Isaacson had been a matter of contention. "Stalin sabotaged it. Here you had the Isaacson and Stalin didn't like that because Isaacson was an old Jewish name. Stalin did choke the Isaacson to death."10


In the late 1990s, I visited the archives of the Lenin Library in Moscow and read the handwritten memos sent by Liuba Sharex-Nemshayskaia to stop the harassment of Russian Jews (she used such words as "discrimination"), many of whom worked for the Soviet government. On 13 July 1939, Sharex-Nemshayskaia sent a memorandum to Molotov and Stalin asking them "to struggle energetically against the many acts of discrimination in every way possible." Later, in 1941, sharex went as far as monotonously repeating a story to Stalin (in English): "Arno Aronovich was told by German citizens: 'Why do you leave Germany. . . . You [Jews] are now considered Soviet citizens."'11


Stalin's nationalist rhetoric appears to have affected the attitudes of some Russians toward the Jews in another way. Russians with nationalistic or ethnic underpinnings of their own began to see Jews in their national context, by contrast. Iona Konstantinov recalls that "the nationalistic waves originating in the Soviet Union on account of the war with Germany gave rise to overt . . . antagonistic moods toward the Jews." New superpatriots and anti-Semites were hard to control. Among other things, Jews were accused of sabotaging the war effort against Germany. "Russian ultra-nationalist organizations and Nazi collaborators" were partly discredited by drawing on antagonism that existed between the Poles and the Jews. The circumstances surrounding Polish-

Jewish antagonism reflected the region's distinctive patterns of anti-Polonism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Russianism. At times, "[i]ncidents of temporary co-operation expressed the chronic hostility among three peoples, who had changed in character but not in habits and disappointments." 12


And in Stalin's worst nightmare, nationalist orientations expressed antinationalist tendencies. Historical bloodletting in which Jews took part against the Russian people was invoked during the so-called Great Terror, when the downfall of Trotsky became a non-Russian Russian, Kosariov's, preoccupation. Let me cite some of the charges against Kosariov:


Knowing of his non-Russian origins, he . . . systematically recruited among non-Russians and tried wherever possible with Jews to bestow in particular positions only Jews, increasing the dominance and power of Jews [vlast'] in the Russian Republic and straining even more the non-Soviet people.13


The perpetual impact of proto-Stalinism on the cultural behavior of Stalin and his cohorts may still be amply demonstrated. Nadezhda Koslovskaia has recollections of her stay in a Magadan camp at the beginning of the 1930s. The inmates were only allowed to leave their barracks one at a time after submitting their briefcases for inspection by the security officers; typewriter ribbons and barrels of low-quality pens were also taken out of their custody. New Tatarization? I believe that the main reason for secluding common files in a separate box was to prevent the suspicious Kazakh prisoners from seeing Russian-language reading materials. The personal possessions of N. Koslovskaia became hostage to Stalinism: nothing with a Russian title or silhouette on it was allowed to reach the hands of the educated natives.


Another story is about the head of the newly established Tatartan industry, Beria's distant relative, who, after the same major's brutal treatment of a number of arrested natives, managed to pass in league with her driver a pile of classical Russian letters as a "documentary proof of improper treatment toward innocent natives." N. Koslovskaia also mentions that the far from innocent major had had reason to be afraid of an offense she was preparing to make in the future"manuscripts by Lermontov and Andreev were printed in bedsheets with an ethnic twist in 1936."14


Beria's bad memory plus the distorted application of proto-Stalinist policies give birth to such acts of surveillance and, in the case of his far relative, to literary disclosure of the era. We are presented with the political exigencies of

Stalinism and its agenda. The complicated game that Stalinism played with its repetitive episodes and structural outlines can be inferred from
