"There's a good chance people thought it was just turtle bones and threw it in the trash, which is illegal," Casola said. The law is called ARS Title13-2919, commonly referred to as the "Dead Animal law."

The Little Children's Garden is a popular destination for families. Center Ciociaro has been a popular center for the area since 1924. The center offered assistance when it moved in thirty years ago and many of the families and children who come to the Little Children's Garden bring their own children for the destination. Because Ciociaro is a longstanding organization, resources have been raised over the years that continue to supply local families with great food. After 70 years, the center is still loved by locals and nearby residents. There are more than 40,000 students and recipients who visit the Center daily.

Meanwhile, in Tucson, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said it was informed of an incident on Friday involving a resident's dog and coyote killing.

The suspect, whose name was withheld, could be charged with illegal disposal of a dead body and violations of the Sheriff's Department Conservation Law.

The suspect saw a coyote with a dead dog in its mouth. The suspect killed the coyote, then worked with a friend who returned to collect a skull from the salvage site.

The two men contacted the 15 th district sheriff. Officers arrested a suspect on Friday.

The carcass of the dog was found on Sunday at the detritus of the dump. An investigator recovered the paw to the remains of the dog, registration number Y-Mar 6600.



Crime scene technicians process footprints and blood scuffs, mainly by a coyote on the ground.



In the immediate area, there were air samples from a coyote and a rabbit. There were no signs that the dead bodies of coyotes were buried or if they were poisoned, except for the paw. Later, on Sunday afternoon, a suspect told a friend that he had killed a coyote as a wildlife officer checked his trash due to rubbish in the canyon.

A scrap of one of the victims was found along with the 10-gram shotgun shell. That leads investigators to believe that the coyote killed two dogs and that the suspect shot a coyote in the fight. It makes sense, even though the remaining dog's bones were ready to be more dog.

The suspect said he disposed of the carcass in a trash can near the house where he lives in near 32nd Street and Cocoraque Highway on North Park area.

The coyote was taken by the Arizona Department of Game and Wildlife in the aim of DNA testing to determine if this is the same carcass in the San Tan Mountain area or it is separate coyotes killed by the suspect.

The suspect has been booked into the Pima County Adult Detention Center with illegal disbursement of a dead body, animal cruelty, violations of the Sheriff's Department Conservation Law, and possession of weapons.

"Coyotes can be year-round residents of our show and live near urban areas," said Priscilla Feral, from Stop Animal Cruelty Now. "If people realized coyotes were the top predators in our show and highways, the coyotes are often the victims of abuse and cruelty. Coyotes can help control wildlife populations and protect wildlife nesting sites and dense shrub users against predators."

The belief that coyotes are a threat to humans is not applicable

"The fact that these wild animals are often labeled as threats to human beings is complete nonsense and does not reflect a serious threat to human being," Feral said. "The truth is that humans have the greatest potential to bite a coyote, especially when coyotes are stressed by people and some people relate dogs to coyotes."

Feral and her group are conducting research on the threats to humans who deal with coyotes, and research on the behavior of coyotes. This research will help people and support better practices with coyotes.

It is important to report suspicions on killing animals and preserving the law with coyotes to the police and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality or the Arizona Department of Game, so that the right steps can be taken to deal effectively with the human, coyotes and other animal problems, Feral said.

"Coyotes are a priority for them," Casola told ABC News. "Unfortunately for me, the younger generation has a skewed view of the problem, we always joke and say it's not a case of animalism, just a little animal murder. I'm sure that the people who lived with any of the two issues thought it was just a joke until I told them about the animal's skin being used as a seat cover, shoes and pillows. "

It is important to remember that it is legal to kill coyotes during open season (December 1 to February 28 of the next year unless they pose a risk of damage to agriculture or livestock.
