She moved to Cochin, in southern India, in 1964 with her husband, Albert Sealey, who was teaching English literature at the local university. They stayed for a year; throughout the year she took photographs of her experiences, due to her “arguing with her husband that photography could really be as creative as painting or writing.” After she returned to the United States, with their two daughters, Nicé, who later became a clinical psychologist and specialised in suicide, and Tiffany, both over six feet tall, she realised what she had experienced was “a series of places, not a plastic grocery or the street.”

This developed into a desire to capture the essence of the people she photographed that lead her to create her comic, anthropological images. At the time she did this, people had not come to India outside of the military and she was “…an unusual American, an ardent American, so obviously not just a tourist…”


Her desire to capture these images, even though she may rely on luck, is determined by the rarity of what she is photographing, for example the water buffalo in Kerala. She decided to photograph the bull in order to save it from a painful death due to the animal being removed from the herd, this led her to photograph the animal from behind a wall where she could not be seen, instead of getting closer and pictures the more confronting side as she has in previous situations. However, she argues, it is her decision even though luck plays a part whether or not she gets the picture.


In part two, titled "Picturing God", Sealey displays the differences between male and female deities within Hinduism. In these photographs, Sealey studied the architecture and the numerous carvings to understand the difference between male and female forms. She believed that because of her feminist views she is used to seeing men as “outside and active, while women are insides and passive.” When she looks at the “perfect” female carvings she finds themselves to appear in various roles such as sad or being harassed by a monkey, but they are still “perfect.” When she looks a “half-finished” female sculpture she finds that they appear to be “…freer, lighter, more active than the fully finished goddess.” She questioned of this, if it is harder for women and men to be “authored,” in regards to an autobiography.


Many of Sealey’s photographs were featured in the solo show "Where Does the World Begin? Who Am I?" at the University of Illinois, in the exhibition catalogue "Rising Currents: Participating in Asian Life and Contexts" and as a display inside the Newberry Library. She also has work in the collection of Smith College Museum of Art. "Picturing God" also was on exhibit in 1989 at the University of Iowa in conjunction with their Asian Religions and Civilizations Program. During this time she had work displayed in "Carved Image: Time and Transformation in Southern India" at the Peabody Museum in the Simmons Cultural Center at the Ambassador Hotel in 1989-90. In the same year her works were displayed in the exhibition "Continuing Traditions: Contemporary Women Artists" at the Cosmo Club. During the same time she had works in an exhibition titled "Marge Moxley: On the Stump" that displayed at the Brookfield Art Center in the South East. "Picturing God" was later displayed at the same venue as "Carved Image". Her work was also displayed in the "Indian Art, Indian Identity" exhibition in a group show at the University of San Diego Museum in 1990.

Sealey's said photographic series in her book "Woven Worlds" are "more plot driven and narrative but still timely." The book is made up of four sections: "Order and Meaning," "Aztlan," "Destiny," "The Fabric of Life." Here she incorporates themes in her work, like ""women’s roles and the context of conflict, hope and struggle," "cultural life and India’s internal contradictions," "reality and the creative and cultural process of living, being human, and learning from past experiences," "the dual cultures of India and how these cultures influence each other,” and "design, complexity and intricacy, as well as motion and restlessness."

Throughout the book, Sealey has twenty-nine pictures, with three whole pictures and four photographs that are misty yellow with words on them. Most of her subjects are “unnamed,” in fact the whole format of the book is minimal because she explains that the “generalized situation present in the photograph allows the viewer to project himself back into it.” She uses empty walls and villages instead of identifiable or named people but because of this, the readers create a sense of “reciprocal participation,” they are involved in
