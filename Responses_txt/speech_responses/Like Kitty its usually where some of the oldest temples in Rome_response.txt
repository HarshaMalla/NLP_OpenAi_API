Its official name is "Campo degli Acquedotti" (literally translates as "field of the aqueducts") and it was part of Rome's "vertical expansion".











The church of Santi Quirico E Giulitta is adorned by some of the oldest, most important Roman inscriptions.

It was built over an ancient Roman temple which was later called "Chiesa della Mattonaia" after the Torre dei Mattoni (Mattei Tower) located behind this church.

In the fifteenth century a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Sacrament was built here.





OK, let's get back to my walks. As I said, that day I was set to discover one of Rome's treasures, but first I strolled around the picturesque surroundings of Campo dei Fiori, while tourists and bag dealers scratched the back of my neck.



Babylon is one of Rome's landmarks and apart from being a must-visit tourist attraction and photo opportunity that draws an endless number of admirers, it's one of my favorite Roman places.

I colored a lot as a child as you can see here and probably most of you have had one of those crayons or pencils in your hands at some point in your life.

They sing, they yell and some of them wet their pants, none of them are normal.



Pleasant memories of my childhood brought smiles to my lips, the constant rush of locals and tourists triggered reflexive waves of "yes sir" 'no sir" "after you, madam" and "with pleasure, sir", and my navigated feet hurt.



I was worn out, but my goal was almost reached. Before I arrived, I needed to navigate a few steps more, because I wasn't in front of "my" window, but a plain boring one, and I crossed it...

Feeling like a stupid, I stared at the thousands of golden fountains and replicas of actual artifacts, and then I thought "What the hell... If it was so difficult to reach here, then at least I need to take a few pictures..."

Because let's be clear: It doesn't matter how uncomfortable, undeserved or valuable the thing or the trip to Mecca is, what matters is that you did it, whatever the trip to Mecca or Rome.





Ready or not, here come the photos.



BABYLON! It seems our harp was eating through gigs really hard...





It was hard to get my head around the fact that such an ugly thing can cost as much as a musician's weekly pay...
