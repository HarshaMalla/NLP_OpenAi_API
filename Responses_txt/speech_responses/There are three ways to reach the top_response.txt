You could climb the stairs, reaching the terrace on the E side of the Obelisk, which has a corniche simply called “La Corniche”. There are 239 plain, flat steps to travel along this high promenade, plenty of places to take your folding chair or prop up your feet for the changing displays; so, get here early for the best spot. You might like to take your friend along too, to take advantage of the services of one of the well-dressed, briefcase-carrying gentleman, that offer a champagne service soon after opening time.

Another “official” stairway on the SW side of the monument is entirely contained within the monument. There are 365 steps on the inside, but if you do the outside you have to do the inside too so it’s 586 stairs total (petooza!). Only extreme die-hards should attempt this one.

The third option is the most fun and it is called the Grand Escalier. It is to the E side of the square and exactly like the corniche, except is open to all and also it is free! It is sometimes closed for refurbishment, but there is always seating available.

Eiffel normally opens to the public from late morning to early evening hours. Typically it opens on time, management opens it up a little sooner, while others arrive an hour later. During holidays, exhibitions, world cup soccer games, Christmas and New Year, the wait time is longer and the entrance fee is arrayed.

Internet Program

You can access a weather report and an estimator on the Eiffel Tower website. It has an online tour of sorts, tickets can be purchased online even, but there is a substantial service charge. Some nice photos are posted, but they are all low-resolution thumbnails which cannot be depended upon to be clear.

Email is available and if you email a group the group coordinator can send an instant message message of up to 160 characters in length. Flash photography is prohibited by the tourist organization, but if you must, first ask to be sure.

Letters may be mailed to or from the tower for €0.55.

There is a tour group office with displays, films and books available in bookstores on the W side of the Eiffel Tower.

At the top of the tower on the NE side is the Muse d’Anatomie, an anatomical museum in the tower; for €4.50. There is a “A science your view” show, which examines the climatic zones that surround the Eiffel Tower; Eur80.00 and the “Marats et-Laze” exhibit featuring paintings by Jacques-Louis David on the square by the Eiffel Tower without the Eiffel Tower. The highest and southern panoramic viewing platform is below the top of the tower and restricted to elevator traffic; €6.80.

The best way to purchase ticket is online at Paris by Night.

Buildings and Appearances

The Eiffel Tower was one of the many Paris structures featured in 1985’s Back to the Future Part II (The DeLorean was tricked out hot-rod and blasting around in the daytime!) In Chicago Ben and I found a book by a great-great grand daughter of Gustave Eiffel which included a fact sheet and information on how to get his key from the Eiffel Tower so that he could reenter his structure (one could imagine the issues of copyright and ownership today... sure is easier going through General Motors...)
