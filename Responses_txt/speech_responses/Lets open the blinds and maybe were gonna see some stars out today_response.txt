Kansas City Royals History... SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA - Drew Butera did what he was brought to the clubhouse to do yesterday.



Translated... Hit a home run!



Butera, who was signed to a Minor League deal on Thursday, belted the first pitch he saw from Tempe Diablo's starter Mickey Storey the fences for a solo shot, giving the KC Royals a 1-0 lead in the 4th inning.



It was one of only 3 hits for the Royals over their 6-inning schedule yesterday.



Mike Aviles was Kris on the spot at the plate today in his 3 AB attempts. Aviles hit a 3 run homerun home run in the 6th inning, giving KC a 4-0 lead.



The Royals tacked on an additional run in the seventh off Chantz Mack, but could not go any further against Tyler Burgoon in the final inning. Burgoon, who tossed a complete game no hitter on Saturday, struck out 4 hitters over the Royals lineup.



Burgoon got Mike Mayers to swing on a 2-2 heart of the plate fastball for the final strikeout and finished off Hamilton with a K on an outside fastball, dropping both Aviles and Mayers to 0 for 4 on home run attempts in their first ABs of the series.



Burgoon was piling up strikeouts well into the 4th inning, and dropped the hook in Hamilton by striking out the side in the 4th. He added another K on the 3rd out of the inning. Mills also used 6 relievers in the contest, including Noel Arguelles, who went unscored upon yesterday and has allowed a hit in each of his appearances in the AFL this year.



Two bangers on the way in the 6th got the Royals Mike Aviles the hat trick! Avilesâ€™s first 2 homers that day came off Burgoon. Aviles, you could go on forever... 5 years removed from his Cup Championship night with the Boston Red Sox, in '07. 3 years out of Anaheim, Jeff is already a seasoned warrior with the Big Red Machine, and doing his thing most nights.



Back in 2012, outside of the good buddy luck that was featured in the same preseason honors section, Aviles went into his last spring training one of the noted future stars who, out of the gate, struggled. Aviles, brought on, penciled in to be one of the premiere offense all-around utility players for the Royals, to plug in at short and second, second and third, he was in the first wave of the future wave of Cincinnati.



Mike Aviles has fought like hell to remain a legit asset to KC who, at times, is critical to the fragile ability of a thousand knives who can't score too. Guys like Aviles, who's out only supposed to be a team leader, can become stoppers if they believe they can be, and if they even remember what they've been through, i.e. ready or not... The struggles of weather, hitting and running the base paths, keeping the health, the mental health, and the trust of the team and the organization, the fans and the ownership are not uniformed.



Aviles trusted. C'est bon, mon amour. Aviles, who's grandm etre can say that he gave 92 years to Quebec and is easily the champ of catches, passed it on.



The Midwest folks by and large are savvy baseball fans. With enough rain, everyone is glued to the TV, worrying about their guys who, to boot, sustain injuries, etc., and generally feeling under the holidays. So, who can be prouder than that?!



Aviles was a top aide for the former Red Sox club. Aviles was trusted with Adam Stern, the new star Doxie, the DH, and now pholdest guy in the Majors. Aviles is a darling.



Aviles went on, last year, to take a position as forth outfielder, his third outfield position. Drew Butera, second base.



Butera also struggled... An American, who did not recognize Butera without the baseball cap last October, never forget to
