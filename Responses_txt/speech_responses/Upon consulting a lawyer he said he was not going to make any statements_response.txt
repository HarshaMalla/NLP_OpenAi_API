The Mumbai Cyber crime police unit has full authority to seize electronic evidence. Often,in these cases, the first step taken is to seize the electronic device which contains evidence of the crime and to do this, the Cyber Crime Unite gets a court order. As per the law, you cannot confiscate either the mobile phone or any other electronic device. So, there is a need to get a court order to seize the device,” said Lodha.





Earlier, the police did not have specialised teams when it came to tackling cyber crime investigations. But now, there is an exclusive wing called Cyber Crime Unit which has a focus on this specific investigation.





"The unit with 185 personnel is headed by an Additional Police Commissioner, who is assisted by the other officers and 20 DSPs.





The cyber cell has offices in Pune at the Maharashtra Cyber police headquarters in Aundh. These officials are skilled and experienced in investigations of computer offences and ensure to be thorough,” he said.





But, how to tackle these groups/individuals is an issue that the police are struggling with. The police also request citizens not to share or post exploitable or 'negative' or 'hurtful' images.





"Generally people think that they are trying to give a genuine message, often there is not such a genuine intention. The incident has already happened and what the person shares on social media is the proof," said an officer.
