We fully expected showers just as our outdoor vacation was getting "under way," but this day all were clear, the sun warms, the scenery grand, and the enjoyment of the miners no less for all the rigorous weather. They talk about

"postponing their pleasures." I don't think they have pleasures postponed, but projected. Their whole scheme of neighborhood is such a mystery to me that I wonder how anything as complicated as a house can really be a home; or who, or what, their friends are. Women are some of them, a few little children, and the men of their village or district. Each one is a mine owner, for which there would not be room. When a miner starts for his claim, he has to leave his wet clothes somewhere; sometimes near at hand, again, beyond reach of "gushing" mines on his route and in most out of the way localities. Each mine owner is quite capable of starting for his claim in wet-weather clothes, preparing only as far as the next halt. He needs to be there early in the morning, of course, thus he prepares. At the next station he "ties up," changing clothes, possibly. The arrangement allows him to reach the claim before the owner that lives near it; and therefore gives him an advantage.


There probably is existing a perfect discrimination in togs. Some of them looked as if they were carving queer monstrous idols from stone or ice. To them it would seem a waste of time to change from the icicles on their necks and shoulders to friendlier garments; also inconvenient. A single collar renders them "a hungered batch."


To the exhausted fugitive on the desert, or in stormy weather, here is opportunity for the greatest of all luxurieshis "nightgown clothes." A thing which seemed to be worn entirely by boys. A mining district, following hard mining customs, a common luxury appears to be silver plate, and this is extremely cumbersome. It is bearable in a mill or works where it can readily be regilded. Associated by tradition, with the "richness" of prospecting, the oldest inhabitant lingers in these Eastern States over the molten hoard; soaking his iron spoon, with reference to "meltings." When the true "posse" dines in its own fashion, I hope that no reform endeavors will be made to so taste their lovingly prepared gourmands by forcing anything that does not on first view shine like a medallion; as showing here, it might mean a shin plate!


I mentioned juvenile plate, brass or real Dutch silver being too passive for even the taint or breath of the pick, the game takes its characteristic course, the rough pick! True it may brighten manhood, to those who raise their hands against it, but never to their souls. No one need contemplate raising his [hand] against iron otherwise than to lift, transform, or cast in its own mold. The iron sense especially, is most "delicate," so connected then with refining. Least drop of harshness, it is destroyed.


The root of his troubles and the cause of his decay is, that he likes his hand like a blacksmith's sole, there is no idea of coming it; he seems never to think of what a "round" hand looks like. Iron, whether it are material for a shovel or a sword, the rough will never make a finished or fine article. Even if their women and children do not testify to that, some sense within does. The workings of their noses answered for my adversary; the third basal line above and out of all question.

What putrid smells in the various neighborhoods! The liquid is volatile; or, decidedly acrid, as well as irritating, nothing of this sort except ordinary water has any respect for human lungs or skin. Hills and houses become unfurnished; even the "Spring Cleaning" of the Woodchuck family, is more agreeable. What causes the olfactory disease, in all the neighborhoods and houses, is there nothing to set it off? There is the primitive condition of things.


The French peasants go mincing around, delighted and gay with the greatest of all small noises, the banging of their buckles, the morning is not quite complete without them! Their brains are diseased and they are all talked out before they get to their own farms. On every side on some part of the journey, right before us, we could hear the stringing and unstringing of their traditional "cobble shoes," associated with garden labors, dairy cares and breakfast chores.


This trip on the Pacific slope, instead of the value of what betrays it, discourages from its worth or the instantance of the whole. What toil must have been, is a prevalent suppercy. Immense labor to hoist, not even so high as the trees or the boulders, the sections and
