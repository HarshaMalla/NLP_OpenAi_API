Don't let them get an apparatus down first.



Don't ever leave a APC alive unless the map's location makes it too dangerous for them to be destroyed.



Use super tank in ambush style.



Use tank's and fortress's explosive canons actively.



Cap fortresses/keeps etc. as soon as possible and use them as a base for everything.



If something doesn't work, don't do it, switch to something else.

Attacking team I:

Pre-set goals, objectives or tasks and divide the attack plan over the players.



Pre-set triggers and time-schedule (the time you will have to have all objectives ready to destroy/they have to be destroyed).



If everything must take place within one respawntime use the sound of your voice instead of the scoreboard to remind the players when the time will be up.

General attacking tips:

Plan the attack after good recon. Making screenshots of the map where the enemy has towers, keeps, APC's, cap points and phase bases is vital for the attacking team.



After a certain round use at least two APC's at all times, to cap the APC is important for the healthpoints.



Monsters and Ballistas can be used to erase enemy towers/Fortresses and to protect your own properties.



Pre-set the gps locations and arrows so the aim just falls at its target. Use places like small ramps or rooms to prevent the aim from being sighted.



If the map has large assest like canyons, use a bird on an adventurous timing to assist in making multiple spams of spamming and spamming them in different locations.



Make use of a point where a defensive team couldn't prevent the GPS lock in, for example when its inside a building and there's a hallway towards the outside.



Use towers to protect cannons/mortars from being shot upon by the opposing party.



Use pot shots to test the defence before making an attack on it, you can use corners of buildings, dark inaccessible spots and some areas occasionally in the region.



If they use elevation to see the full map use low elevation to see the depths since this gives the advantage of looking at them firing their weapons upwards.



Flashbangs are not only useful to yourself to gain time. Hook up flashbangs to enemy towers so they disorientate the enemy even more.



When defending a tower/Fortress/keep that hasn't been destroyed yet, use a turret and some APC's to make it hard to be killed. The turret needs to be of a good class or there's a real risk of dying too fast.



Use weapon strategy and effective things like the quick flashbang to disable the aim, to save you some more time before jumping into a spammer, for example.



Know the location of your phase base(s) and which phase-caps it has and as soon as you can spring one of these location as strategy to win the round.



Try to keep aware of where your teammates are to avoid any friendlyfire accidents.



Reduce the chance of skill blunders by medic-boosting your teammates before the attack.



When you have achieved a surefire attack objective (for example 3 APC's to a tower, or 2 if the only basic attack plan was fortress control) react to your skill. If you know the you are skilled and you have set up everything while the enemy tried to command their basic attacks, use the APC to shield your fast attackers to shatter the enemy team's base. The attacking team needs three APC's or 2 APC's and a fortress or 2 APC's and a tower done to escape a FFA round.



If you are down, if you leave the kill feed, you have failed. Never disappear unpunishable.

Defence team:

Pre-set goals, objectives or tasks and divide the defence plan over the players.



Pre-set trigger mechanisms and time-schedule (set the respawn time to one round and use sounds to alert the team when its 30%-, 10% and 5% left).



After a certain round use at least two towers at all times, to damage the opposing team's APC(s) and cause more destruction for the maximum destruction.

General defensive tips:

When defending a tower/Fortress/keep that hasn't been destroyed yet, use a turret and some tanks to stop the enemy destruction.



Use weapon strategy, if turrets have no hope of defending themselves against the fast attacker, but they are capable to be able to pin the attacker fast enough, give them a boost to suffer less damage while they destroy the incoming enemy.
