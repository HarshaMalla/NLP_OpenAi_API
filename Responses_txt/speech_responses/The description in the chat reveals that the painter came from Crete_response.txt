The Walters Art Museum

The Walters Art Museum is an art museum located in Mount Vernon-Belvedere, Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a public museum that is owned and operated by the City of Baltimore. The museum's collection was begun in 1845 by prominent Baltimoreanas. The city has a large and active arts community, including the historic Mount Vernon Place, row houses and other dwellings with fine decorations, and many churches.



Over the decades, the museum's holdings grew by major donations from the Henry Walters family, the Ellicott family and their descendants, with the museum giving many works to the Baltimore Public Schools, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Peabody Institute according to recommendations by an independent board of philanthropic and educational advisors, as well as a study of educational needs.



Other local institutions undergoing renovations of their galleries have loaned works by Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro and four small works by Peter Paul Rubens, along with other works on paper, to The Walters, providing seven months' worth of art viewing for visitors. After that time the artworks return to their owners, usually on long-term loan.



The Walters' collection of Walters Decorations, objects of art designed primarily for churches has come to the Walters and comprises some of the best examples of the "jesuitical" style of Catholic art in Britain, and older churches can display these artworks seasonally. A Blue Angel in silver, a memorial to a Walters son who was killed in the First World War, was stolen from the museum on January 24, 2008, by a former security guard.

According to FBI records, Don came out of the US Mail Room, presumably in the State Department, and didn't have much formal education, but became a teacher, had a talent for languages, worked for CIA. See www.feriowilliams.com/biography.htm

Donald Ferebee Williams graduated from Tabor Academy and went on to study a little history and languages at Trinity College, in Hartford, Conn., but he soon decided that being a lawyer wasnâ€™t for him, and he quit. He went out on his own, apparently getting involved in the mail room for the State Dept. till he came across a physician who knew that a writing project for the CIA was coming up, and he applied for the job, whereas he has little formal education, but the project gave him a foot in the door. For a couple of years he worked at Langley, in the CIA's Art Division, which noted his facility with languages. In 1950 he joined Opus Dei. He lived a fairly normal life, as a teacher, although his language skills led him to some interesting work, [language has many subtle meanings so it can mean whatever one wants it to mean] his early administrative offices were not-so-interesting, and he was never at a top level of the Agency, working very independently. Then, in 1958, perhaps because of the new style of Rome, in which Vatican II was starting, the nature of Papal patronage changed.

CLAIMED TO HAVE CAUSED THE SECOND VANGUARD DISASTER



After it was cleaned out, the Art Branch was unofficially renamed the Art Division and its top officials began to send agents out on cover jobs as artists and teachers. No longer would a secret have to have as much importance to it to exempt it from the decorative urge of a sec agent. The division became one more thing to sell to Foreign Information Services and not just a convenience for the White House. It seems that the new pope had come to the realization that there is no art so subversive as the black and white paint on paper, canvas or handmade tapestries.

Don had a drawing of a naked women he was cradling--his scarred hand over her breast indicated the wound that killed the woman--that was used on newspapers when the bomb went off. As the story goes, after the explosion someone had brought painters in for the restoration, even long after the dead numbered into the millions, and it is said that Don thought he saw a "Ramming" signature in the debris.



Certainly a special pattern of the kind he had been witness to was in the makeup of the bomb that brought the new African Pope down--a bishop who was supposed to intercede and prevent what had already been caused by its design. An American Sec agent didn't have them sign the bomb, however. [I've got to keep remembering the whistle-blower letter so that I don't get confused as to who is killing whom.]
