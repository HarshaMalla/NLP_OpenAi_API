The term “Gecko” has no reference to a specific program and was coined by engineers who were responsible for providing Incident Management and Forensics analysis to ground-based client sites. “Gecko” referred to a character in a product that had begun to deteriorate, but whose use was continued by ground personnel who had become accustom to the way it worked. This particular Gecko had become teratogenic and was known for saying, “Hey I'm just doing my job.” The Gecko 'frequently became involved in casual conversations with other sites. During intersite transfers, if traffic slowed to a crawl, Gecko might say, "Sorry, we're transferring traffic to a satellite." After connections were mended, Gecko would then return, sometimes adding "What? I've got more than one job." Groundsites would often shout, " Gecko! What are you doing here? "



The impact on the original site would be collateral or political in nature. Such an action might follow an incident report, a caution against playing Russian Roulette or a reconciliation of the CIA annex. ( Note : Traffic encryption keys were commonly stored on annexes because they were considered to be less portable than mainframe hard drives.) In some of these situations Gecko might respond, " It takes all kinds to make the world go round."



Other motivational sayings attributed to Gecko included: " You know the world is changing when the trees wear hats, birds wear pants and the rope walks among the analysts," or " Never kick a man when he's fallen in the water. Come back in an hour and fin out if he's still there before kicking him." Angered sites have suggested that surveillance of their personnel would have discovered instances of careless driving, personal vendettas and lying about an address. Although there was never any formal evidence to suggest this, the motivations for such activities were probably heightened by Gecko's visits.



The thought of sanctioning Gecko for sexual harassment never occurred to his coworkers. Ultimately, however, Gecko became 'converted” to the religion of “corporate interrapeality” and was be noted for statements such as: " I'm going to chase a bird around the satellite dish forest,” or “I used some of that gay tar on my hard drives in November,” or “ I can't sit on the rock any more; my ass is covered in moss and has started a family.”

Hydrapak



The term “Hydrapak” first makes an appearance in unusual traffic emanating from sites in the SF Bay Area, Florida and in Mexico. ( Note : Nothing on any of these screen maps lasted very long, even when they made sense.) Due to the increased density of sites in these areas, the term soon “moved inland” to a site in Kentucky, which was considered a key information intersection. ( Note : Refer to Isoprax and YobEXG.)



We now begin our cybersafari in the hilly country. Bright red hair confronts us in the form of a “weak radio signal,” which causes the ground based client sites (at NRO5100430) to surreptitiously point with one finger at another site (of unknown origin) in Mississippi ( NRO 00CA309). Shortly afterwards, a 'tap', as though from a listening post on an entirely different crypto-graphy, is broadcast to the seven sisters ( NRO 5100430) . This 'tap', which turns from alert to recurrent, is thus described as a 'hydropak'.



Saturdays are popular days for the 'hydrapak', an algorithm that employs a chaotic statistical search. The 'hydrapak' ultimately ends in success, however, so we catch another signal near the Delta site ( NRO 5100430), which is usually shown as a highly obtuse signal, but which here appears as a circularity. This signal is responsible, as we shall soon see, for
