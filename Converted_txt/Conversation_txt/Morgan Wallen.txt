off your schedule situation. Yeah, it really is. And what do we think about it? Well, dear listener, that is what we will be sharing with you today. Our take on Morgan Wallen, country music darling. I'll start here, Matt, with a question to you. Do you think Morgan Wallen is an idiot or a genius? Must he be one or the other? Well, you know, which side of the pond is he on? I think he's on the idiot side of the pond. I have thought that for these three weeks, but something is starting to tickle the back of my brain, thinking maybe this guy, in the words of Marco Rubio, knows exactly what he's doing. Now, it's possible, you know, that every right move he has made on his path to the top of the country music mountaintop has been carefully directed by a team of advisors, and we mentioned the dozens of writers on this latest album. He's getting a lot of help, no doubt about that. But I want to jump back in time to the immediate aftermath of his N-word situation. Oh, am I about to take back what I said? Let's hear it. Mm-hmm. Shortly after he was caught on camera by TMZ using a racial slur, and after his record label suspended his status as a signed artist, and after radio stations dropped him, and yada yada yada, after streaming services bailed on him, all this, he got on Instagram. The video you saw was me on hour 72 of 72 of a bender. Morgan himself, and made a classic Instagram selfie video apology. This is all pretty standard, par for the course. But one thing he did in that video, Matt, is say, don't defend me. Don't come to my defense. Lastly, I have one favor to ask. I appreciate those who still see something in me and have defended me, but for today, please don't. I was wrong. It's on me to take ownership for this, and I fully accept any penalties I'm facing. The time of my return... Matt, that was a deft psychological move, because what happened after that is everyone came to his defense, and he sold so many more albums after that. He became too big to ignore. They had to, you know, unsuspend him. They had to keep playing him on the radio. They had to put him back on Spotify and Apple Music, because money talks. And he was making so much money after he disgraced himself, and then so brilliantly said, don't defend me. Tim, I will grant you that that was deft, because, I mean, not only was it deft, but that was sort of the four-dimensional chess that we talk about in a very real way, because we have all seen any number of celebrity apology videos and notes and posts and such. And it is very rare for someone to simply fully own it and then say, don't defend me. Often they'll try and squirrel their way out or offer, you know, mitigating circumstances and ask for some understanding and forgiveness. Or they take a step back, right? You know, they say I'm just going to step out of the limelight for a while. There you go, yes. He didn't do that. That didn't happen with Morgan. No, he went into the limelight even more. The spotlight is shown brighter on him than ever. There's a lot to say about what it means morally for everybody to pick him back up and kind of act like nothing happened. I'm sure we'll get more into that more, but Matt, we got to talk about these tunes a little bit too, because they are really terrible. Yeah, I mean, where to begin, Tim? I mean... Maybe we should start, why don't we start with his hit single, his, the number one song in America, Last Night. Last night we let the liquor talk. I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all. You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met. But baby, baby, something's telling me this ain't over yet. No way... Give me your snap take. What do you think about this? Okay, I'm going to try to not lean too heavily on this, but it is worth mentioning that Morgan Wallen did not write this. He had no part of it. In fact, he wrote 13 of, or he co-wrote 13 of the 36 songs on this album, which interestingly shakes out to 36 percent. So 36 percent of 36 songs. Just want to say that. That is interesting. 40 chest right there. I mean, Tim, this song is, I mean, it's not a good song.
