Hi everyone, I'm Jack from Jack's English. And I'm Luke from Learn English Like a Pro. And this is our very first episode of our new podcast. This podcast is designed to help you improve your listening through our natural discussions. Yep, and today we're going to talk about eating habits. Yes, right. Which I think is something that we can all understand and talk about. It's very interesting. I can hardly stick it out. Yes, right. So I think that's the best place to start is with bad habits. Right. So how about you, Luke Do you have any bad habits I think I'm perfect. No, I'm joking. I have, yeah, of course, everyone has bad habits. You know, when, as soon as you asked me that question, the first thing that came to mind was pizza. Yes. Pizza and any bread. Like I can just binge eat on pizza and bread like this all day long. And it's obviously really high in carbohydrates. Probably high in salt. Makes you fat, makes you tired. It's bad for most things, right Yeah, but it just tastes so good. Yes. What kind of pizza do you like I like Hawaiian pizza. Oh, no, not Hawaiian pizza. We've talked about it. Pineapple on pizza. I love it. Oh, really Yeah. Yeah, that's a big dividing pizza, isn't it Some people love it, some people hate it. Yeah, I think having a bit of pineapple on pizza, on a burger, makes everything better. Really It's so good. Yes. Well, for me, I think probably my biggest, my worst eating habit is that I snack while I'm watching movies, particularly. So I like to graze on sort of chicken, some delivery chicken, popcorn, of course. I love to graze. So, you know, I'll be watching that movie and my hand will just keep moving. And I think when you eat like that, you end up eating so much. Yeah, totally. And it's, you know, a movie's two hours long. You can get through a huge bucket of popcorn in a two-hour movie. Sure. Easy peasy. So I'd say that's my worst eating habit. I think I'm a little like you as well. You know, I tend to eat too many things like pizzas and bread. There's some pretty good bread in Korea, isn't there Yes, totally. Actually, yeah, so for those who don't know, we live in Seoul. And Seoul has become kind of a Western city in a way, especially in terms of food. And there are so many local bakeries. In like every little area, there's like four or five little bakeries and they have like their wholemeal bread, they also have their cheese bread, their kind of raisins, fruit bread. It's not that unhealthy, but the thing is you just eat too much. Yes, that's the problem, isn't it Yeah, exactly. And it's taking a lot of room that you should be using for things like fruit and vegetables. Exactly. I'm not sure about you, but when I have a tough day at work or I feel a little bit tired, the only thing I want really is pizza. Oh, really Because that's something I need to cut out of my life, is like coming home, sleepy, ordering the pizza. Yes. For me, it's the spicy chicken. And I thought that was kind of okay, but a lot of my friends say a lot of spicy food is not good for you. Okay. Have you heard the same No, why is that Right, that's what I want to know because I love spicy food. But I've heard it's not good for you, it's not good for your stomach and I don't know. So perhaps I should cut down my spicy food. Yeah, totally. Yeah, actually, I mean, we eat a lot of spicy food together, don't we Yes, we do. We like our spicy sauce. It just tastes, it's so good. But yeah, it is, I do feel a little bit kind of always thirsty after having like really spicy food. So I must have a lot of salt in it. Yes, I think so. Maybe that's why. Yeah. So how about some good things then Let's talk about our good eating habits.
